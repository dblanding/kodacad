  <h1>Getting Started with KodaCAD</h1>

  <h3>Creating 3D models</h3><img src="images/wp.png" width="481" height="423" border="0"
  alt="" />

  <ul>
    <li>The basic paradigm for creating a 3D model is to start by drawing a sketch on a
    2D workplane.</li>

    <li>The workplane contains two types of drawn elements: <b>Construction</b> and
    <b>Profile</b>.</li>

    <li><b>Construction</b> elements, as their name implies, are used to construct an
    accurate layout. They are the dotted magenta colored lines, infinite in length.</li>

    <li>Where Construction elements intersect, 'selectable' yellow <b>Points</b> are
    shown.</li>

    <li><b>Profile</b> elements, if they form a closed loop, get converted to a <b>wire</b>
    which is then used to create or modify 3D bodies.</li>
    
    <li>Both  <b>Construction</b> elements and <b>Profile</b> elements are drawn by 
    clicking on <b>Points</b> or by entering values on the <b>User Input</b> widget.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The User Interface</h3><img src="images/ui.png" width="792" height="509" border="0"
  alt="" />

  <ul>
    <li>The main <b>3D Display</b> window is the 3D view of workplanes and 3D parts.</li>

    <li>To the left of the <b>3D Display</b> is the <b>Tree View</b> window, showing the
    hierarchical relationship among Parts, Assemblies and Workplanes. In addition to
    displaying hierarchical relationships, the Tree View window also allows user editing
    of certain parameters, allows Parts, Assemblies and Workplanes to be shown/hidden
    (using the checkboxes) and shows (by color):

      <ul>
        <li>Which <b>Part</b> is <b>Active</b> (the part that will be acted upon by
        the current modification or operation).</li>

        <li>Which <b>Workplane</b> is <b>Active</b> (the workplane that will be
        acted upon by any toolbar buttons).</li>
        
        <li>Which <b>Assembly</b> is <b>Active</b> (Newly created parts will be added to
        the active assembly).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The <b>Menu Bar</b> is located across the top of the application window. In
    general, 3D parts are created with a workflow that starts with the menu buttons on
    the left (<b>Workplane</b>) and prcceeds to the right (<b>Create</b>, then
    <b>Modify</b>).</li>

    <li>The <b>Toolbar Buttons</b>, located on the far right, are used to create drawing
    elements on the <b>Active Workplane</b>.</li>

    <li>Along the bottom of the application window, from left to right are:

      <ul>
        <li>A <b>StatusBar</b>, showing instructions, if any, for the user</li>

        <li>A <b>User Input</b> widget into which numerical values (v), 2D coordinates
        (x, y), or other text (such as part name) can be entered.</li>

        <li>A <b>Current Operation</b> label, showing the current opertion.</li>

        <li>An <b>End Operation</b> button, allowing the user to end the current
        opertion.</li>

        <li>A <b>Units</b> label, showing the currently selected units.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Navigation</h3>

  <p>Using a scroll-wheel mouse, the user can rotate, pan and zoom the model in 
  the 3D Display Window.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>LMB for rotation</li>

    <li>MMB to pan the view</li>

    <li>Scroll wheel to Zoom the view</li>

    <li>RMB for popup options (on both Display and Tree View)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Download &amp; Installation:</h3>

  <p><b>KodaCAD</b> is very much still in development and is not being made available
  in an executable binary format. In order to run it, you need to have Python version 3.7
  (or higher) and pythonOCC (version 7.4 or 7.5) installed on your computer. The easiest
  way to get this (the way I did it) is to:
  
  <ul>

    <li>Download and install <a href=
  "https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html"
  target="_blank">Conda</a> (Choose Python3, not Python2.7.)</li>

    <li>Once you have got that, set up a PythonOCC environment within Conda.</li>

    <li>Within that environment, install    <a href="https://anaconda.org/dlr-sc/pythonocc-core" target=
  "_blank">pythonocc-core</a> and <a href="https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pyqt" target=
  "_blank">pyqt</a>.</li>
    
    <li>Clone the KodaCAD GitHub <a href="https://github.com/dblanding/kodacad" target=
  "_blank">repository</a> onto your computer.</li>
  
    <li>Then from within the PythonOCC environment, run the file "kodacad.py".</li>

  </ul>
  
  </p>
